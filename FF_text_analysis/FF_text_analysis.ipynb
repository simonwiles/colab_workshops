        "2. **Transform.** There are many strategies for turning your textual data into numbers, and `scikit-learn` has built-in libraries for most of them. Usually you'll begin by making a list of the words that apear in a document (a \"bag of words\"), but probably you'll also want to count the *frequencies* of the words in each document (BoW counts). In `scikit-learn`, this is done by a type of transformer called a `CountVectorizer`. We also must  choose whether to exclude uncommon words (i.e., words that only appear in a few documents) or very common words (\"stopwords\"). These high-level settings as a whole are called **hyperparameters** (different from **parameters**, which are the values learned by the model from the training data that enable it to make predictions).\n",
        "3. **Train.** You'll need to choose which learning model/algorithm to use, either by reading the documentation or talking to your friendly neighborhood data scientist. After choosing a model, we train it on part of the labeled input data (the training set).\n",
        "4. **Test.** We then use the trained model to predict/infer the labels of the remainder of the labeled input data (the test/validation set).\n",
        "5. **Assess.** Apply one or more metrics (scores) to evaluate how well the predicted labels match the actual labels of the test/validation set. If the performance is unsatisfactory, we'll need to backtrack, possibly all the way to step #1, getting more labeled data and applying different transformations/hyper-parameters as needed, and/or trying a different model."

Although its formulation can get confusing, all the math boils down to counting, multiplication and division, making Naïve Bayes (NB) classifiers very fast. On the other hand, NB makes the assumption that all of the features in the data set are equally important and independent, which is obviously not true for words.
